# Time Dependent Schrodinger Equation

Now that we have a comfortable foundation for setting up the PIB paradigm, we can take this a step further and apply it for the time dependent schrodinger equation. We have already discussed that a stationary state is an energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian operator. Stationary states have well-defined energy, as they describe a single energy state. There are only contributions from one energy state to the overall state. 

We are already familiar with this portion of code. It was explained in the last section; it simply sets up our PIB. 

```Matlab
function TDSEa(n)
hbar=1;
m=1; % mass of electron
l=1; % length of box 0.5 nm (written in meters)
pts=300; % number of discretized points
w=3; % number of points within infinite wall
x=linspace(0,l,pts)'; % discretized space
dx=x(2)-x(1);
barht=1E6; %bar height on potential matrix
c=-(hbar.^2)/(2.*m); % constant in kinetic energy operator
D=(1/((dx)^2)).*(-2*eye(pts)+diag(ones(pts-1,1),-1)+diag(ones(pts-1,1),1)); % second derivative matrix
T=c.*D;
Vvec=zeros(pts,1);
Vvec([1:w,(end-(w-1)):end])=barht;
V=diag(Vvec);
H=T+V;
[vecs,vals]=eig(H); % determining eigenvectors and eigenvalues
[srtvecs,srtvals]=eigsort(vecs,vals); % sorting eigenvalues in ascending order
EtoX=srtvecs; % change from energy basis to position basis
XtoE=inv(srtvecs); % change from position basis to energy basis
psiE=zeros(pts,1); % vector of all zeros
psiE([1])=1; % change position 1,2 in vector to 1
psiX=EtoX*psiE;

%How to shift on displayng graph
% sc=100; 
% srtvecs=sc*srtvecs;
% v=diag(srtvals); % vector of sorted eigenvalues
% repvals=(ones(pts,1))*v';
% shiftvecs=srtvecs+repvals;
```
Here, we begin to delve into setting up our PIB. Please follow the comments for each portion of code denoted by the "%" before each line to understand its function in MatLab.
